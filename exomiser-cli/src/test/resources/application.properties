#location of CADD/REMM Tabix files - you will need these for analysis of non-coding variants.
#CADD can be downloaded from http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/download - v1.3 has been tested.
#REMM can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/exomiser/downloads/exomiser/remm

#You will require the tsv.gz and tsv.gz.tbi file pairs.
#Un-comment and add the full path to the relevant tsv.gz files if you want to enable these.

#If you're running exomiser in batch mode there might be some performance benefit
#if you enable caching. The mem option will continue to store data in memory *without*
#limit - this means for really long-running batch jobs and/or whole genomes you may run out of memory.
#If this is likely choose the ehcache option and configure ehcache.xml to your requirements
#none/mem/ehcache
